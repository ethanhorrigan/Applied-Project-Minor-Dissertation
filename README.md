Production App:
Register your project to apply for a Production API Key with access to the Standard APIs and/or Tournaments API. A Production API key requires a working prototype. Production API keys are not for testing purposes. You may submit an application in the planning stage of your project, but your application for a production key wonâ€™t be approved until your project is ready for public consumption. Work in progress should be tested using your demo key.
